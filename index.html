    <h1>About Us</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p>The Optimistic Autistic is more than just an app. It is a blog, book and inspirational app to help inspire and inform parents and caregivers of special needs children. Our aim is to encourage others to not only keep their heads up but to share their stories, as we share ours.</p>
    <p>There is much to gain from sharing your story. Not only do you gain courage, but you also strengthen others with your story. </p>
    <p>As a parent of an Autistic child, I know that it can be a lonely and trying time for not only the parents, but the entire family. I also know that I wouldn't trade the experience of raising our Jordan for nothing in the world.</p>
    <p>Check out our app. We encourage you to check out our blog at: <a href="http://www.optimisticautistic.com">http://www.optimisticautistic.com</a> and to read our testimony: <a href="http://www.blackbirddetectiveseries.com/optimisticautistic.html">The Optimistic Autistic: Our Testimony</a></p>

    <h1>Tips for Stressed Parents</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p>Here you will find tips to make your day easier. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Doctor Appointments</strong><br />
      <br />
    When scheduling doctor appointments make sure to inform the receptionist of any foreseeable issues (e.g. need to be in a quiet area, morning or afternoon preferences, anything that will make it easier on your child during their visit).</p>
    <p><strong>Be your own advocate</strong><br />
      <br />
      Advocates are useful to those who do not understand Special Education law and procedures. While some parents are well versed in Special Education law and can move through the process with ease, many are not so lucky. Special Education is quite complicated. Many times an advocate will save you heartache and headache.<br />
      <br />
    There are many people out there willing to help parents and special needs students, however locating these people may be a trying task. As a parent who struggled with locating support from outside of our home, I would suggest that you start at home.  </p>

    <h1>Coping Mechanisms</h1>
  </div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p>Here you will find information to help you cope and rejuvenate yourself and your family. Each day we will post a new mechanism to help you cope with caring for a special needs child. </p>
    <p><strong>Get a Life, Literally</strong><br />
      <br />
Think about it. When it was just you, what made you happy? What hobbies did you have before having children? Once you find that out, you must act. </p>
    <p>Believe me, you will find a way to do what you love. If you are honest with yourself about your dreams and your passions, you can enrich your life. Try it.</p>
    <p>Once you start doing what you love, you will be immensely rewarded. I adopted a large repertoire of hobbies after Jacobâ€™s diagnosis. I found that my hobbies helped keep me grounded. I make it a goal to add a new hobby each year. </p>
    <p>Since writing is my passion, I wrote four books. I also learned to sketch, no matter how elementary it looks, it was fun. I have taken swimming lessons, design websites and crochet in my free time.<br />
      <br />
      I am constantly questioned on how I find time to do these things. These things are essential to keeping me grounded. I need to write. Writing is my escape from my often chaotic life.<br />
  <br />
      This is a part of loving oneself. To love yourself you must find out what works for you. <br />
  <br />
      Then you must pursue it with a passion. </p>
    <p>After all, you are not on the earth to solely parent. </p>
